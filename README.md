# _breseq_

_breseq_ is a computational pipeline for finding mutations relative to a reference sequence in short-read DNA re-sequencing data for haploid microbial-sized genomes. _breseq_ is a command line tool implemented in C++ and R. It will compile and function on a variety of Unix platforms, including MacOSX and Cygwin. It reports single-nucleotide mutations, point insertions, and deletions, large deletions, and new junctions supported by mosaic reads (such as those produced by new mobile element insertions) in an annotated HTML format.
